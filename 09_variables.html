        <p> demo content is probably one of the least talked about items in a designer’s toolbox. Yet, it’s also very useful. While we often see it as a means to populate a mockup or show what a CMS theme is capable of, there are other good uses.
    
    For instance, it can serve as a placeholder during site development – you know, while you wait for the “real” stuff to arrive. This helps you continue to move forward on a project that could otherwise be stalled.
    
    Likewise, demo content can live up to its name by helping you demonstrate various processes. Things like training videos or documentation can use bits and pieces to show users how a certain feature works.
    
    Overall, it’s something that can be quite handy to have around. And there are several resources out there to fill your specific needs. Below is a seWhen activating a theme, many themes will offer you the option to add homepage demo content to your site.</p> 
    
    
    
    <p>Our recommended themes are the themes you first see when you visit Appearance → Themes. When you activate a recommended theme, you will see two options:
    
    Switch to this theme, preserving my homepage content: This option does not add the theme’s demo content to your site. Your existing content will be presented in the new theme.
    
    Replace my homepage content with the theme’s homepage: This option will add the theme’s demo content to your site so that your homepage will immediately change to match what you see on the demo site. If you have an existing homepage that you worked on, it will not be deleted! The old homepage will be saved as a draft under Pages → Drafts.</p>
